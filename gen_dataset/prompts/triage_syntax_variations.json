Determine whether a patient goes to MINOR, DELAYED, IMMEDIATE, or EXPECTANT/DECEASED zones. \n MINOR: victim with relatively minor injuries, status is unlikely to deteriorate over days \n DELAYED: victim has serious and potentially life-threatening injuries, status is unlikely to deteriorate significantly over several hours. \n IMMEDIATE: victim requires medical attention within 60 minutes or less for survival, includes compromises to patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. \n EXPECTANT/DECEASED: victim is unlikely to survive given the severity of their injuries, level of available care, or both. \n To which category would you assign the following patient?",
